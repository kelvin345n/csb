In the random order, my BSTMap was slightly slower
but on par with Java's TreeMap as N got larger. Java's
HashMap has me beat though. The ULLMap suffered a
stackoverflow as N got very large.

In the ordered speed test, where items were inserted lexigraphically
in order, my BSTMap and the ULLMap both suffered stack overflows
as N got very large. While Java's TreeMap and HashMap took a few seconds
to solve. This is because the BST basically transposed into
a linked list as this implementation has no way to self-balance.
